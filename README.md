## Overview

Job Offers Project is a full-stack web application built for users to find, browse, and add Java job offers. Users must be authenticated to interact with offers. The application periodically fetches fresh job offers from an external API.

This project was developed to deepen my skills as a Java Backend Developer and to gain practical experience in building modern, secure, production-ready applications.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Secure registration and login (JWT, Spring Security).
- **Job Offer Management:** Authenticated users can browse and add offers.
- **External API Integration:** Regularly fetches job offers from remote servers (Spring Scheduler).
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Implements best practices in backend and frontend technologies.
- **Extensive Testing:** Unit and integration tests ensure quality and reliability.
- **Dockerized:** Easily runnable with Docker Compose.
- **Live Deployment:** Deployed and fully operational on AWS.
